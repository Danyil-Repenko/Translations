In the darkest of the nights a "clap" occured somewhere, In
Belgorod region it scared the bitches, And
They all're turning tail 'cause something's burning there,
And nobody knows anything - all the hands are up.

Hands up everybody, shout out who did this?
"-[in rus] We don't know, we don't know!" Hands up, higher!
Hands up everybody, we're reaching new horizons,
It's not an air raid
It's Zaluzhnyi throwing a bash!
Bash
Bash
Bash
It's Zaluzhnyi throwing a bash!
Disco. Bash
Disco. Bash
Disco. Bash

In the darkest of the nights near Bryansk city
An "itsy-bitsy clap" happened and the smoke's already sky-high
Something also went down in the city of Rostov
The one could hear a "tiny clap" above the airfield

Hands up everybody, shout out who did this?
"-[in rus] We don't know, we don't know!" Hands up, higher!
Hands up everybody, we're reaching new horizons,
It's not an air raid
It's Zaluzhnyi throwing a bash!

In the darkest of the nights in pitch-Black sea
A ship sailed to a shore and, what a tragedy,
He was said to go fuck himself, so he ran off, cocky bastard
Was hiding somewhere in the sea, but the "Neptune" found him!

As one "Moscow" had sunk, the other one will burn,
'Cause Zaluzhnyi's party-maker, hands up everyone!

"clap" - word that russian propaganda replaces "explosion" with.
Valerii Zaluzhnyi - Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine; one of the reasons Ukraine could withstand fullscale russian invasion.
